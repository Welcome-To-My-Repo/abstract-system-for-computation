Intermediate representation is either interpreted, jitted, or compiled.
the compiler image will try to interpret the code in the IR form to provide easy debugging

infinite general purpose registers.

static specific purpose registers for context maintenance.

Stack register:		$
	used to manipulate the stack
Base register:		_
	points to the base of the memory provided for that context
Instruction register: 	^
	points to the instruction being interpreted.

Instructions are separated by a line break
instruction components are separated by a horizontal tab
