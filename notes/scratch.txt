================================================================================

New Function syntax:

because ASC has equality expressions, something like,
	f(x) = x
also counts as an equality.
This creates a problem because equality expressions evaluate to a boolean even 
if they bind variables.
So now I need a lambda constructor which does not rely on the equal sign or
binding.

lambda syntax needs a way to declare multiple parameters and a definition.
say parameters x and y. Output will always be the last expression so parameters
aren't necessary.

1. Function type way
	x y -> x + y

2. Lambda Calculus way
	/. x y . x + y

3. anonymous function way
	(x y) x + y

4. alternate anonymous function
	(x y) -> x + y

5. Without lambda symbol
	(x y) . x + y

6. Using commas
	x, y -> x + y

7. currying (ew) ((ASC explicitly supports collections so functions should work
over collections too
	x -> y -> x + y

8. {x y} -> {x + y}

9. x, y . x + y

10. , x y . x + y

11. / x y . x + y

12. * x y . x + y

13. | x y . x + y

14. (x y) . x + y

Modules:
	| ... | ...  | ... |
Types:
	[ ... ]
Collections:
	{ ... }
Functions:
	( ... )

15. (x y -> x + y)

16. (x y . x + y)

17. (x y) -> x + y

parens followed by arrow seems best and most recognizable.
A function tuple followed by an arrow
although using currying is interesting.
or instead of currying, allow collections on either side.
For example,
	x -> x + 1
or 
	{x y} -> x + y
and 
	{x y} -> {z = x + y   z + 1}

and then function application is simply juxtaposition
	f = {x y} -> x + y
	f(x y)


mutation/assignment operator, _ << _ 
is separate from equality and binding.
instead of assigning variable, updates value.
call it  "clobber".
only works on Data.
x:Register = 1
x = 1
x << 2
x = 2


function is not equality, it's rewriting.
In math, 
	f(x) = ...
is used as both definition and to refer to the function object itself,
as soon as higher order functions are used, function names become variable bindings again.

f(x) = -> x + 1
f(x) = x -> x + 1

function is a context to evaluate some expressions.

x -> x + 1

(x y) -> x + y
is actually 
{x y} -> x + y
{x y} -> {y + 1  x + 1}

f = {x y} -> x + y
f = {x:T y:T} -> 
(x) . x + 1
(x y) . x + y
(x y) -> x + y


how to do multiple parameter functions?

what are functions? they're contexts.
you can inline every function and still get the same behavior.

there's different notations though.
do you want to declare all types and parameters up front, or have them be natural parts of an expression?

	x:t -> y:T
vs.
	x:t -> t {y}

functions are important and need to be distinct from other syntax.
just write down what I want them to look like.

f = x -> x + 1
f(x) -> x + 1
(x) -> x + 1

f(x:T) = -> x + 1
f = x:n -> y
f = x:m -> y

in geometric meta language, there's transformations between features.
	x = [x]
	y = [y]
	x -> y
it can be multiple types as in
	x = [x] y = [y] z = [z] 
	p = [p] q = [q] r = [r]
	x.y.z -> p.q.r

polymorphic functions are piecewise case-matching over different parameters.

a transformation is 
	x -> y
a function is
	f = x -> y
where f is bound and x is unbound such that
	f(p) => (x = p) -> y

what does it mean to parameterize something?
parameterization adds independent variables.

a variable becomes bound at the point in a program where it is certain that 
the variable can only be substituted with a single existing entity.

variables are bound using equality and functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


functions are transformations between features.
functions can transform a collection of features.
the syntax is 
	x -> y

what is a polymorphic function?
it's a collection of transformations which are mapped piecewise to cases of
parameter types.

	t_a = []
	t_b = []
	f(x) = -> p(x)
	f(x:t_a) = -> q(x)
	f(x:t_b) = -> r(x)

	f = {x y} -> {g(x) m(y)}
same as
	f(x y) = -> {g(x) m(y)}

Is notation a lambda or an equality.
probably an equality because you don't necessarily need a function for everything.

; x 'yuck y ; = yuck-fun (x y)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no comments, annotations instead.
you can ask the compiler to look up documentation about bound variables.
annotation operator is ` and it takes a string after it.
so 
	x = 1 
	x ` "bound to 1"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to explain the top level?
can't assume that compiler writers will know how to evaluate expressions.
there's no such thing as order of operations.
all expressions are left associative because things are read left-to-right.

prefix stuff is always done before suffix stuff. THIS IS GOING TO BE ANNOYING THO
take this example:
	x = {1 2 3}
	y = {1 2 3}
	y.0 + x.0 = ((y.0) + x).0
	`when what i want is:` (y.0) + (x.0)
is this order of operations? yes.
do i do order of operations for notations? maybe.


what about supertypes.

	T = []
	U = [T]
	V = [T]
	x:T

associativity based on types.

say there's operations across some type

; x `+ y = add(x y)

now depending on the types of x and y, you can change associativity.
	; x:T `+ y:Expression(T) = add(x y)
is left-associative because the Expression syntax type makes explicit that 
some other stuff must be evaluated first.
	; x:Expression(T) `* y:T = add(x y)
is right-associative.

a + b + c = (a + (b + (c)))
x * y * z = (((x) * y) * z)

This also helps enforce general operator precedence.
Take for example addition and collection access.

given an expression without precedence:
	1 + x.y = (1 + x) . y
but when addition is defined as 
	; x:Expression(Number) + y:Expression(Number) = add((x) (y))
then 
	1 + x.y = (1) + (x.y)
due to the definition of Expression being an entire notation, not a constant, variable
or symbol.

That gets me into syntax types because there's several...
- Character:
	Everything that can be written uses one or more characters
- Symbol:
	A sequence of characters delimited by blanks (unless some other delimiting rule is applied)
- Constant:
	A specific sub-class of symbols which correspond to numeric values
- Terminal:
	A symbol which represents an operation and is not evaluated.
	- Variable
	A symbol which evaluates to an entity.
- Notation
	A single operation supplied with operands which are not other notations.
- Expression
	A single notation supplied with operands which may be other notations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what's the deal with equality, is it full unification?
how is this enforced?
anything that requires evaluation is reserved for runtime checks? idk

say
	1 = 1
those are both constants which are evaluated at compile time.
unification is special though, so does it get clobbered by macros? yes

equality has to do with variables and determining which entity a variable evaluates to.
a special case of equality is assignment.
if an equality is written where only one side has a single variable, then that variable is always bound to whatever is on the other side.
if there are previous bindings which are not possible with the new binding, those bindings are undone.

given bound and unbound variables, there's also the notion of dependent and independent variables.

there's also the special case of function polymorphism. i.e.
	f(x:T) = -> g(x)
	f(x:U) = -> h(x)

so variable binding is 
	x = 1
where x is bound to 1

Independent variables allow for constraints and refinements, but how to specify that independent variables are being used?
Take the expressions,
	x = 1
	y + x = z + x

so the three things I want to do with variables:
- bind them
- use them independently of their bindings
- automatically drop previous bindings that conflict with a new one

binding variables:
	x = 1
	y = 2
	b = 3
equality comparison:
	x = 1
	(x) = 1
using independent variables
	z = 1
	f(z) + x = g(z) + y

but how to use independent variables which are the same symbol as bound variables?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

very excellent analogy:

ASC is a tool, just like any other.
More specifically, ASC is like an angle grinder. 
Angle grinders are used in almost every craft because they are powerful, precise, and highly versatile.
The only stipulation is that you have to know how to use one properly.
For example, the object you're grinding must be held in a stable position and there's only a few safe ways to hold the angle grinder.
If you use one the right way, angle grinders come with many safety features so that you will never be surprised or hurt.
Unfortunately most craftspeople don't bother to learn proper safety techniques before they use an angle grinder.
This often results in cases of permanent maiming or even death.
When you use ASC properly and safely, you'll create practical and beautiful things.
Make sure to learn what proper use and safety mean for ASC or else you and others could get hurt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what things are declarative in my language?
equality statements are declarative.
they affect what things may be true in a context.
do lambdas affect things? no, they're entities.
there's no syntactic unification because lambdas don't rewrite, they evaluate.
thus there's evaluational unification.

what about lambdas as used to make independent variables?
usually you say
	y = x + 1
where y represents the return value of some f(x) and x is independent.
but in ASC, you would have to do
	y = f(x) = -> x + 1
but what about non-functional independent variables?
	x + 1 = y + 2
this would look like
	{x y} -> x + 1 = y + 2
The unification is now stuck inside a lambda context.

what I want is quantification.
higher order quantification?
how does this work with types?

existential involves binding a variable so
	x = 1
is the same as
	"there exists an x which is 1"

quantification is... types?

is this higher order logic, or lower order logic.
I can't do pure existential or universal quantification.

here's the thing though, unification can be reduced
	x + 1 = y - 2
	x = y - 2 - 1
	y = x + 1 + 2


so how do I do binding in my language?
is it explicit, or is it implicit as part of equality and unification?

unification takes two expressions
; x:Expression `= y:Expression ; = ? (x) = (y) True False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how to talk about collections.
collections are 
	{ ... }
things inside them can be named
	{ a b c }
they can be given values 
	{ a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 }

but now I want to talk about sequences.
its a collection where everything is the same type and only the cardinality matters
what do those look like?

using the sequence type
	Sequence(3 Byte)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dependent types?

stuff where types can depend on values.
that's called a function.
to make a list type that depends on a length, you define the list type as a function of length.

what does polymorphism look like
well the function form 
	( _ ) -> _
means that the function is evaluated immediately (a let notation)
when you supply the function with variables, but on new bindings, then it enforces those variables to be independent on the RHS
	((x = 1) -> x + 1) = 2
	((x) -> x + 1) 

(x) -> f(x) = x -> i
(x:P) -> f(x) = x -> j
(x:Q) -> f(x) = x -> k
(x:Q) -> f(x):l = x -> l

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

unification algorithm:

unification is an equality of two expressions which returns a boolean true if the expressions are equal or a boolean false if they are not equal.
	(1 = 1) = true
	(1 = 2) = false
unification is evaluational so two expressions must yeild equivilant entities otherwise the unification will not hold.

unification is effectful because it will implicitly bind variables.
so in 
	x + 1 = 3
x is bound to two. And in
	g(y) = f(2)
y is bound to a value where if g is applied to it, it's equivalent to f applied to 2

there is a special case of binding where a variable appearing by itself on one side of the equality will always be bound to the other side
any previous bindings that conflict with the new binding are discarded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

expression types:

symbol
	a symbol
constant
	a symbol which is a number
notation
	a single operation such as function application with no nested expressions
expression
	any operation with or without expression nesting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

functions:

the function constructor:
	; x:Any `-> y:Any ;
function application
	; x:Function y:Any ;

so now i can say 
	f = 1 -> 2
	f 1 = 2

you can do polymorphism like
	f:Function
	f 1 = -> 2
	f 2 = -> 3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a collection is { ... }
and inside it has a bunch of bound variables.
it can also contain equality constraints.
a simple collection is
	{1 2 3}
collections are just sequences of expressions
	{f 1  g 2  h 3}
how are bindings managed in collections?
the collection constructor enforces that all bindings are local to the collection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation model:

Evaluation is based on reducing expressions by substitution.
Expressions are built of constructors, variables, function applications, and modules.
These can be organized in terms of variable binding orders.

Constructors are 0-th or bottom order because they do not involve any binding.

Equalities are first-order binding.
A single variable is bound to a single entity.
That variable may be replaced with that entity wherever that variable appears.

Function applications are second-order binding.
Rather than being directly subsituted with an entity, function application corresponds to one or more expressions.
Those expressions must be reduced in order to substitute the function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

special operations which have implicit or effectful behavior.

Evaluation: ( ... )
Equality: ... = ...
Function Construction: ... -> ...
Type Construction: [ ... ]
Collection Construction: { ... }
Function Application: _ ...
Module Construction: | ... | ... | ... |

these expressions all affect variable binding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is an effect system?
It's a method for declaring an abstract typed event and assigning some function to be evaluated when that effect occurs in code.
Allows for safe(er) non-determinism.

What is the effect model.
Same as object model? Yes.
Instead of context, object which has effect handlers and may emit effects.
Where does an object fit into the language model? Object is a type.
Because types are geometrical objects.

Are operations objects too? Yes, functions are objects according to the type system.

So a type has effects, effect triggers, and effect handlers.

two objects can emit the same kind of effect so handlers can be designated to handle an effect for a specific object.

what is an effect?
An effect is an event that results from evaluating an expression, including the evaluation itself.
An effect is part of the system of types like everything else.
There is an effect type which classifies all effects.
An object can emit an effect.

An effect has a trigger and a handler.
A trigger is some event which is classified by that effect.
A handler is some expression that is evaluated when the effect is triggered.

from the high level, an algorithm may be complex enough to arrive at an invalid step.
the environment may also become invalid while an algorithm is still executing.
effects allow an algorithm to react to an invalid environment or to restart from handling an invalid step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

context switching
rosetta code task:
"Using either native language concurrency syntax or frely available libraries,
writea program to display the strings "Enjoy", "Rosetta", "Code", one string 
per line, in random order.
Concurrency syntax must use threads, tasks, co-routines, or whatever 
concurrency is called in your language."

	f = {	r -> {display "Enjoy" (r 's1 )}
		r -> {display "Rosetta" (r 's2 )}
		r -> {display "Code" (r 's3 )} }

	print-all = null -> {
		(thread f.0 a  thread f.1 a  thread f.2 a)
		a = x -> ...
		f <<< filter f x
		(f.0 b  f.1 b)
		b = x -> ...
		f <<< filter f x
		f.0
	}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variable binding with recursive functions.

the rule of independent variables appearing on both sides doesn't work because
everything appears on both sides.
	f = x -> f x

	x = y 
	x:t y:t

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuations, exceptions, all control flow is contexts.

A context contains a set of bindings, an entry point, an exit point, and a part 
of a program.

context operations:
	create		- creates a context
	enter		- enters a context
	exit		- exits a context
	bind		- binds an object in a context
	clobber		- destrutively changes a binding
	handle		- handles an effect
	emit		- emits an effect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

functions are used to enter contexts.
contexts are nested.
handlers are registers per-context.
contexts are dynamic instead of lexical.
a context is some control point bundled with all the bindings required to continue at that control point.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DYNAMIC FUNCTIONS ARE ACTUALLY A TERRIBLE IDEA
THEY SUCK DON'T DO THEM

the flow of control for any program outside of a parallel environment will always 
be linear.
things like coroutines and delimited continuations will always reduce to 
continuation passing.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

modules and collections are the same.
only difference is encapsulation.
also inclusion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

semantic model:

objects have features.
objects can be typed according to their features.
objects can be applied to other objects.
object application may yeild another object or change something about the object its applied to
applying an object may emit an effect. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full delimited continuations must have 6 capabilities...
1.) 	Asymmetric: be able to move control back to the point where the 
	continuation was called.
2.)	Stackful: act like a regular function with its own context and stack.
3.)	Delimited: have a finite definition that doesn't contain the entire 
	program.
4.)	Multi-prompt: ability to be nested and recursive.
5.)	Reentrant: dynamically capture the program state at a given point as a
	callable continuation.
6.)	Clonable: ability to duplicate any continuation object.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how do functions do multiple arity?
take a function "f" that requires parameters "x" and "y".

f x y -> x op y
f z -> z.x op z.y
f {x y} -> x op y
f = (x y) -> x op y
f = {x y} -> x op y
z = {x y}
f z

a function constructor after a collection construtor exposes the names inside 
the collection to the function body.

a function constructor after an expression constructor causes the body of 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events, Event Triggers, and Event Handlers

The underlying environment and objects within the environment may change 
due to external conditions. When they change, an event may be triggered.
Triggers may be external or internal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

functions create contexts and destroy them.
continuations are additional operators to preserve a context and to create 
additional entry points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"continuations"
contexts as first class entities

three operators:
	- continue
	enforces that the immediate context and any bindings it closes over is
	preserved until the expression has been evaluated

	- begin
	creates a new context with dynamic extent

	- end
	discards a dynamic context

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contexts

given "(1 + 1)", there are two resources, the left and right operands, which 
become bound while the operation is performed. Once the operation is complete, 
the resources and their bindings can be discarded.
A "Context" is the combination some operations and the bindings required to 
complete the operations.
given "x << 1, y << 2, z << 1, y + z, x + y" you can group these expressions 
by the contexts they create. "(x << 1, y << 2, (z << 3, y + z) x + y)" notice how
the second nested context allows z to be discarded before the 
last operation is performed.
functions allow a context to be declared lexically.
the above expressions can be rewritten using the function constructor "->"
"(x -> y -> { (z -> y + z)(3), x + y})(1)(2)"
functions defined this way have a lexically bounded context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

one continuation operator which replaces a context with another.
contexts are delimited as functions.
you have the option to create dynamic functions which implement dynamic contexts.

_ ... _

contexts are named as functions.
lambdas have a "this" operator.

normal function definition uses a collection of expressions.
x -> { a b c ... }

dynamic function uses a dynamic collection of expressions determined as the program runs
k -* 1 ... y *- k

dynamic function have to be named so they can be closed

the create operator names a new dynamic function and yeilds an initial value.
k -* 1

the close operator delimits the body of the dynamic function and yeilds a
value that the dynamic function will return if it's called again.

the context switch operator replaces a function with another expression

f = x -> ? x = 1 f ... 1
f 1 = 1 

(x = 1) -* k

what does 
	x -* k
mean?
x is not provided a value so any use of x cannot be evaluated.

maybe it means 

	x -* k
	y = x + 1
	k *- y

that anything in between the create and close operators is not evaluated.
But what if you do this?
everything is an expression there are no control statements in the language 
primitives.
you can create functions that return null

what does replace return?
the result of its second operand.

in 
	_ -> <> ... null
	is null

dynamic scope is delimited?

take f _ -> {

	( _ ) -> {
		(x = 1) -* k
	}
	'does k still exist here?'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT!!

Variable binding and function binding is sugar for syntax binding.

` 'x ` = 1
is the more verbose version of 
x = 1

Syntax data types capture syntax which can be evaluated in several different 
orders.

Take an expression that captures a nested expression.
	`'e x:Expression` = (x)
This expression simply evaluates to the expression it captures. 
It does not evaluate the captured expression.
There is no real difference in the order that the expression is evaluated here
because as soon as the syntax is evaluated, the expression is immediately 
evaluated after.

	`'e x:Expression` = (~'x)
This version of the syntax evaluates the expression immediately.

Contexts, Continuations, Conditions.

How to make a notation for that.
Contexts are collections of bindings and expressions you evaluate.
Functions and collections are refinements of contexts.
Context constructor is { ... }
Create a context by constructing and binding one
Discard a context by discarding the binding.
Context entry is a fuction call or condition
Context exit is the continue operator.

what about dynamic contexts.


Dynamic contexts 
	.\ /.
create a new dynamic context with the name ”x”
	.\ x

exit the dynamic context
	x /.

what does this do?
It creates a collection of bindings resulting from the expressions evaluated
in between.
How does it work in scope?
”x” shadows any previous bindings and appears as a local binding in all inner nested contexts.
When ”x” is closed, the name of the context remains visible as a local binding until the outermost context containing the binding is closed.
The dynamic context can be passed as an entity to other functions.

dynamic functions parameterize dynamic functions
instead of an expression or a collection, a dynamic context is given as the final parameter to the function constructor.

------------------------------------------------

Conditions are a means to dynamically define and evaluate an expression

A condition is defined as an entity and expression pair.
When the entity occurs, the expression is evaluated.

c | e

This applies to Collections as well.

m = {a = 1 . c = 'n | a}
m 'n

in order for a condition to be attached to a context, it must be bound

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Register is a data-level constructor which allows the programmer to create very
low-level layouts of data.

Primitive types are Nat for unsigned and Int for signed. Each the cannonical size
of the environment's Register.

Register takes a list of value ranges and other register types.
The list is one indexed.

Register < ... >

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collections are encapsulated by default.
Members are assigned by binding.

How to talk about the type of a Collection?
It can contain complex unification expressions and piece-wise bindings.
First, I don't really know what gets an entity included as a member in a 
collection. Does it get included simply by writing it? 
	{ 1 }
Is 1 a member of this collection now? Yes. How is it accessed? IDFK ugh
Members are completely encapsulated. You can't access them from the outside.
How do you access them from the inside?

{ 1 x = This 0 }

This keeps an index of all entities in the context.

I want to be able to do the following declarations:

	{1 2 3}
	{x = 1. y = 2. z = 3.}
	{'x | 1. 'y | 2. 'z | 3}
	{x = p. y = q. z = r.}
How do I access things that have no name?
Also what is the use of members when they're encapsulated?
Maybe non-bound members aren't encapsulated? 
	But now you have implicit projections for only part of the set.
	This just turns confusing.

I want an encapsulated collection where all members are identified.

	{ ;;"Everything in here is not accessible externally" }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collections

Collections are multisets.
You can have one or more elements repeat.
Collections are compared structurally.
Each element is distinct and countable.
Elements are ordered.

Elements can be selected from collections.

c = {'a 'b 'c}
c/'a


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's my minimal language?

Natural numbers only.
Functions: _ -> _
Collections: { ... }
Types: [ ... ]
Expressions: ` ... `

Low Level System API implements something like Vulkan for rendering and 
general purpose compute

What is an expression type?
Is it like a function type? Yes. When a function occurs, it gets reduced.
When an expression occurs, it gets reduced as well.
An expression binds some parameters.

` 'F x:Nat `

How do expressions work? Apply in the context they're bound in.

The expression constructor constructs a pattern to search the input for.

Expressions are functions, "when you encounter this, do this"

Should symbols or parameters be easier?
Parameters should be easier, symbols should be explicit.

When is an expression engaged? Is it first class? Does it return anything?

An expression is first class. It's an expression itself and can occur inside a 
type constructor.
What are the semantics for how an expression can be engaged then?
Is an expression valid in the context it's bound in? Yes.
Does an expression include what it evaluates to, or does it sit by itself?

` ... ` vs. ` ... -> ... `

What's the concept of defining something that taints the contex it's bound in?
Seems like an expression just by itself doesn't do much unless you explicitly 
provide it to the context by operating on the context.
Contexts are the same as images.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What can images do?
They can internalize or import parts of other images or entire images.
They can provide encapsulation and interfaces.
Are images based on names or entities? Entities. Images have structure.

Go back to the "Structure/Suface" object paradigm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementing modules is weird because in a pure type system, the line between 
what is a specification and an implementation is blurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binding is 
	x : 1
where x is an unbound variable and 1 is an expression that x will evaluate to.
Alternatively, you can bind expressions to each other, as long as the two 
expressions can yield equivalent values.
	1 : 1
The expression on the right is allowed to yield a type of the value on the left.
	1 : Nat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how does syntax work?

if you look at lisp, you describe syntax as a macro.
the macro is engaged using function syntax.

in ASC, the macro is engaged by some matching pattern.
the pattern can be composed of individual characters, symbols, unevaluated expressions, or typed entities.
A sequence of characters is grouped into symbols using grouping rules.
Symbols are grouped into expressions using binding rules.
Expressions are evaluated into entities.

What is the ordering. Is it possible to have ambiguity? 
Say there's two expressions defined:
	`'a x:a`,
	`"a" x:b`,
which comes first?
the character match comes first?

characters are matched first, then symbols, then expressions.

two things:
 how are expressions contextual? 
  through types
 how are expressions bound by context?
  binding.

binding is where an entity is bound to an occurrance within a context.
There's a few ways things can occur within a context.
An expression can be constructed in the context.
A symbol representing the binding can occur in an expression.
An expression can be bound to a condition.

There's a concept of implicit bindings.
No there's a concept of variables.

If I say 
	x : 1
then where x occurs, it's guaranteed to evaluate to 1.
But now what is x?
For an unbound variable, `'x` : 1.
Rather than talking about variables, talk about just syntax.
No variables, you bind expressions.
Expressions can be recursive, 
	`'x id` : id
	
	`'add x:Nat y:Nat` : x + y
	add 1 2
	
what happens when you do
	`1 + 2`
does it get evaluated?
What happens when you put an expression inside an expression constructor?
What happens when you put an entity inside an expression constructor?
	` 1 ` 
1 is now bound.
When that expression occurs, it yields an expression.
What happens when an expression is not bound to anything?
Binding is implicit.
What about expresisons.
Expression as a data type is inherently unevaluated.
so what happens if I say 
	` 1 `
But that's not actually the real question because 1 isn't primitive.
What happens if I say
	` _ `
There's no bindings here.
What if I say
	x : ` _ `

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You describe an expression as 
backtick followed by an expression description followed by an arrow.

`x` 1
m = (`x` 1)

an expression enforces a bindidng. 
where that syntax occurs in a context, that expression will be evaluated.

when you construct an expression, it binds its corresponding expression in This.
Then, evaluation of an expression becomes the process of determining an
expression form and then searching for its map within This.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the concept of This (%).
"This" refers to the immediate context.
The context is the collection of bindings.
For example:
in a block
	x : 1 , This x = 1 . 

in a collection
	{x : 1 .  This x} = {x : 1 .  1}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if code blocks are comma separated lists, how do you nest lists?

	a, b, c
	a, (x, y, z), b, c
	a, n -> x, y, z . , b, c

comma is an expression concatenator, if I have 
	e , e
then that's one expression
	(e, e)
the period delimits expressions so when you write
	e, e .
it's the same as
	(e, e)
and 
	e, e . , e
is
	((e, e) e)
Function constructor expects an expression but is also an expression itself.
	e, x -> e .
is equivalent to
	(e, (x -> e))
so you begin a nested expression with either parentheses or some other prefix
delimiter such as "_ -> ..."
the period always delimits the inner expression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

functions are both binding and parameterizing.

to describe a function you need a parameter type and a result type.
to construct a function, you need a parameter name and an expression.

to describe a function, you write
	[Function T : T]
to construct a function, you write
	f = x -> y
together, you would write
	f:[Function T : T] = x -> y

Can I do 
	f: Function T : T
yes, Function is the type of all functions and can be applied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the mechanism behind refinement typing?
refinement typing happens by using two things:
	implicit quantification
	type constructor

implicit quantification is where types and values are the same entity, however
types imply that multiple values can occur at the place where the type is used.
value should be yielded.
If a type is used where a value can be used, then the expression over that type is computed for all possible values of that type, producing another type containing all the possible values of that type.

the type constructor accepts any set of unique values and produces a type representing those values.

Thus
	A = [1 2 3],
	f = n -> ? (n = 2) n _ . ,
	B = [f A]
or alternatively
	A = [1 2 3],
	B = [n:A, ? (n = 2) n _]
where the entire type is computed at runtime.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expression constructor describes how an expression is formed.
An expression can have several components:
	- parameter
	- symbol
	- string
	- series
a parameter is a place in an expression where another expression can be nested.
the result of the nested expression is bound to a variable.

a symbol is a form of punctuation which uses a non-evaluatable symbol to demarcate the form of an expression.

a string is a form of punctuation which uses a non-evaluatable string to demarcate the form of an expression. it is different from symbols because a string can be identified in any character sequence without following symbol grammar.

a series is a place in an expression where an unknown multiple expressions can be nested.

the following expression contains one of a parameter, symbol, string, and series.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

can you include the same number of types in a type definition?
	[a a] = [a]
is that the same type? not necessarily.
are both types 
	[a]
yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what about set operations on types?
say there's two types, A and B. 
I say that C can be the values of A and B by
	C = A + B
If I say that C is the diffefence between A and B
	C = A - B

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

there should be a sub-language where all variables are bound and there are no 
uses of the colon. in other words, type checking has been erased because the 
program is provably sound.

Issue is conditions which are determined at runtime. Right now, every condition
has to be guarded by a conditional evaluation.

	x : (n:Nat, ? n > 1 n _),
	y : (n:Nat, ? n < 99 n _),
	100 {
		x | 1 .
		y | 2 .
	}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different kinds of code blocks using expressions P, Q, and R:

Expression List (implicit delimination)
	P , Q , R

Expression List (explicit delimination)
	P , Q , R .

C-like code block
	{P , Q , % := R}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

syntax binding problems
you can bind symbols as variables by putting them into expressions unbound,
	x : 1
	x = 1
but you can't do the same with 
	`'x` : 1
	`'x` = 1
what's 
	` 'x p:t l * "k" `
by itself? An expression.

functions over syntax are separate from macros.

how to treat syntax as data?

in lisp everything is a paren delimited list.
lisp has cons for making new lists.
what does ASC have? Collections.
how do you represent syntax as collections?
in lisp, the head of the list is the function, and the rest of the list is the
arguments.
in ASC, the collection type corresponds to the function and the elements of the 
collection are the arguments.
so 
	1 + 1
in lisp is 
	(+ 1 1)
and in asc is
	(1 '+ 1)
which returns a collection
	{1 '+ 1}
you can do nested expressions this way
	((3 '- 1) '+ (7 '- 5)) = 
	{{3 '- 1} '+ {7 '- 5}}
You can interleave evaluation like so
	(2 + 2 '+ 2 + 2) =
	{4 '+ 4}
so how do you evaluate this?
	you just evaluate it
	(1 '+ 1) = {1 '+ 1}
	({1 '+ 1}) = {1 '+ 1}
	({1 '+ 1}:Expression) = 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

semantics of first class expressions

Expression is a construction of values.
The structural type of the collection corresponds to the expression it 
represents.
Nested expressions are represented by nesting collections.
How is an expression different than a regular collection? It has semantics for 
what to do with the values in the collection.

An expression is constructed anonymously like all other computable entities.

Binding an expression in a context makes the expression available within the 
context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of `This`

Evaluation takes place within a context. 
The context contains all entities.
Additionally, the context contains the mappings between expressions and their
meaning.
Evaluation is performed by determining the expression and then fetching its map
from the context.
The context is a structure of nested collections.
It represents the activation record of functions and blocks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I should not provide any operations for combining sets.
Say that you have a type T.
You can extend the definition of T with a new type, t, by writing
	T := [x -> x T t]
where you provide an identity function on T and a new type.
It is possible to extend T as
	[T t]
however, the new definition of T has the old definition of T as a value such 
that
	T' > t
But if you use an identity function, then implicit quantification separates T
into its values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you be able to type the parameter of a function? Yes, however you do it
in the function body.
	f : x -> x:T
alternatively, you specify the function type, then the function itself.
	id = Function T:T . : x -> x
or use a block
	id:Function,
	id T = x -> x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How are expression sequences delimited.
	a , b c
	a , b , c
	a , b , c .
	a . , b . , c .
There's three expressions above, how are they delimited.
	(a, b) (c)
	(a , b , c)
	(a , b , c)
	((a),(b)),(c)
Function definitions are a problem because they have no ending delimiter.
That's fine if the function just composes other functions, but it gets ambiguous when you define a function over a block.

	f : x -> g h x
vs.
	f : x -> y : g x, z : h y
in the second example, if this function was defined inside another list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A module is a single file.
You write a bunch of expressions inside the file.
Expressions that you bind are visible in the context when you import the module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collection accessor operation is the backslash.
Ex:
	c = {'a ”b” 3} .
	c\'a, c\Nat, c\Character


-- Execution Model

How does ASC execute stuff?
Execution is part of the ASC module.
The environment initializes the default ASC module. 
The module provides functions for handling file and text submission.

Implicit Qualification:
Implicit quantification involves applying an operation to a type, implying that
the operation is performed for all values of that type, producing a new type 
that represents all the values possibly returned from that type.



How do I describe a self describing system?
Corecursion.
I say that a system "x" is given the properties "y", which are defined by a system "x".
I describe ASC as a program which interprets ASC, written in ASC.
Then the definition is a matter of what external information is required to comprehend the program.
What external information is required?
... Default expression syntax
... Default expression semantics
... Requirements of a correct program
... Requirements of the default module
... The manner in which evaluation can be reconciled with the real environment.
Oddly enough type rules are not external information, but are part of the interpreter.



How does execution happen?
You submit a program definition to the environment.
This program can affect other programs by modifying the context.
A program depends on the context.



What does the environment provide?
... Storage
... Placement

What does evaluation provide?
... entity duration
... structured context



How are expressions typed?
An expression is a sequence of syntax primitives, a collection.
So it is typed as a collection.
You instantiate an expression by listing syntax values inside a pair of backticks.
Expression parameters are filled by non-quoted expressions or more quoted expressions.
Because expressions are also structured data, building a quoted expression is as simple as constructing a collection.
Constructing an expression type requires a new kind of notation.
Or does it?
If an expression is a collection of syntax primitives, then the combimation of a collection and function is an expression.
The pairing represents the correspondence between syntax structure and semantics.
How is the function paired?
By constructing a condition dependent on Null.
This way, a collection formed as
	e = {_ | 1}
will immediately evaluate its condition wherever its used,
	(e) = 1
Eval inspects a quoted expression to determine if if matches any of the structures of the expressions bound in the context.
A quoted expression is not required to provode null conditions because it only represents a structure, without semantics.
Now I don't need backticks.

How to insert and delete elements of collections?
It involves clobbering.
Setting something to null erases the binding.
Using destructuring provides direct access.
Use clobbering assignment.
Remove an element
	c/e := null
add an element
	c/e := e
or 
	c//#c := e



When parsing expressions, the Read function takes a written program and builds an expression.
The problem is that part of the expression may alter how Read builds the expression.
Now you need to interleave Read and Evaluate so that once an expression is determined, it's evaluated in order to accurately reflect any changes that the expression might make to other parts of the program.
Read and Eval can be interleaved by evaluating an expression as soon as it's built.
What should the function be called though? 
Just Eval?
- Eval
- Evaluate
- Interpret
- Compute
I think it should be Compute.
Compute is polymorphic across all forms of a program.
Compute can use an image, a native image, or program text.
"Compute"
What to call standard output?
- Print
- Show
- Display
It should be Display.
Display prints an entity as the program that computes it.



I have a function "Compute" which performs a computation however it is represented.
I have a function called "Display" which shows a program that produces the object being Display'd.



Should it be possible to construct the same type twice?
Yes.
How then do you construct a comoletely new type?
	t = x:Type, ? -. (x = *) x _
Create a unique subtype
	p:T = -. (Type:T = *:T)
	q:T = -. (Type:T = *:T)
The converse should be possible.
If every new type is unique, create two of the same type.
Just copy
	p = [*]
	q = [*]
	r = p
	-. r = q



Collections have maps which allow you to match on an object.
	t = ['a 'b 'c],
	c = {a:t b:t c:t},
	


ASC environment functions:
... Compute (effectful)
... Compile (discrete)
... Describe (discrete)
... Disassemble (discrete)
... Display (discrete)
... Export (discrete)
... Import (effectful)
... Inspect (discrete)
... Link (effectful)
... Obfuscate (discrete)

Functions are classified as either discrete or effectful.
A discrete function changes the environment but has no effect on the image.
An effectful function has an effect on the image.
Compile, Describe, Display, and Export evaluate to null values.
Compute, Import, and Link can be used in a program.
Effectful functions should be given operators as they are part of the primitive language.



There should be a sublanguage within ASC that resembles Forth. 
All types are fixed.
Variables are reduced to context accesses.



assume a POSIX environment
start the utility
opens an input line
compute what gets entered



Can images have a function that executes automatically? Yes.



How to compute?



Documentation comments, how do they work?
You have a string and a semicolon and a string.
On the other side of the string is an entity.
If the enity is a symbol constant, then the documentation is affixed to the 
symbol.
If the entity is an expression, then the documentation is affixed to that 
position in the written program.
When you ask to describe something, you can submit either a symbol or some program.



How does the system exist?
You have to invoke the environment which consists of the environment commands
which affect the environment. The environment supports an image.
Every time you invoke the environment, it opens a new image.
The image contains any bindings that are computed.
The image also contains the default context with all the definitions.

Basic image functions:
- Compute
- Display
- Describe
- Import
- Export



What is the minimal subset of the language?
Algebra over registers.
Boolean logic over registers.
Collections.
Locations.

A function call looks like instantiating a new collection in This and then setting it as This.
Different than a stack. That's because architectures may become different.
Key is all bindings are erased so there's only context accesses.
Need context switching.
Operations on Registers.
Activate and Exit Context.
In the sub-language, these are explicit.
In the normal languahe, these are implicit in function calls.
Is the operator hidden? If so, then it's a DSL.
It should be possible to set a context to anything.
What does switching a context look like?
Entering and exiting the context is an address.
No what is %?
It's a special binding with special semantics?
No, you should just be able to set it and find the previous context.
Maybe that's %\0. 
Yeah the external context.
So what is the minimal subset?

This	%
Index	\
Clobber	<<
Number	0123456789
Arithmetic
	+
	-
	*
	/
	//
Logic
	/\
	\/
	-.
What is the sub-language?
Collections of Registers and Bytes.
Add elements to the collection.
Add collections as elements.
Types are Register, Byte, Collection.
Operations:
Access element		_ \ _
clobber			_ << _
arithmetic		_ +-*/ _
logic			_ \/ /\ -. _
location 		_ @
dereference		@ _
collection		{ ... }
this			%
conditional		? _ _ _

This is the subset.
It does not have abstract types, everything is a program with registers and bytes.
It has collections.
All binding is reduced to indexed contexts.
There's no function calls.
Contexts hold both code and data.



What can be represented by a program in my language?
It's clear that everything is metacircular except for the string that Compute reads from.
What about maps?
Submitting an entity to a collection where it decides if the type is correct or not.
That counts as a program.
Not really.



So lets just go with the fact that everything in my programming language is primitive and maps to a program. 
That was the original goal anyways.
At least it has more explicit semantics for how it maps to hardware with datatypes than C does.
Can you make a new Register type?
That's just a collection.
You have to pad collections.
That's easy, just throw a byte or two in between stuff.
You can make a macro that does that.



Should GC be part of the primitive language?
Yes, it's how the context gets managed. 
Entities that are still accessible cannot be discarded.
Can't really consider this full GC, but rather callee cleanup.



What does the structure of the implementation look like?

There is a managed execution environment which provides the initial context and the Compute function.
The environment also provides discrete functions for getting documentation about entities and programs.
All you need is the compute function and the initial environment.



How do I represent syntax as data?
In Lisp it's just a list.
In ASC it's a collection, I know that much.
How do I set the difference between a normal collection and an expression?
It depends on how the Compute algorithm treats them.
Is there a type difference between an expression and a normal collection? 
No, an expression is just a normal collection.

Should I have a means of describing an expression?
No it's just a collection.
It's all in the notation.
The apostrophe is the quotation symbol.
You build an expression from quoted stuff.
Anything unquoted is evaluated to build the quoted thing.
	'(1 + 1)
in this quoted expression, what is evaluated? Nothing.
What about in this quoted expression?
	'(1 + 2 - 3)
What if I get rid of patentheses?
Then I need a symbol quote and an expression quote.
	'Symbol
	'' Expression
How do I evaluate stuff inside the expression?
You just evaluate it before you put it in the expression.
	x = 1, y = 2, '' x + y



The context (%) or This has special maps for default objects.
	This 'Function
returns the function that is currently being evaluated.
	This 'Context
returns the context containing This.

Elements of a context are not required to be positioned relative to each other spacially.



No keyword. What symbol makes a new register? $
The dollar sign makes a new register.
	$ Register Byte Byte Register $



What should I call a map?
{1 | 1} .
- Condition
- Map
- Association
- Effect
- Trigger
- Handle
- Surface
A surface



How does an image work? What do you do with it?
An image is a collection of entities.
When you import an image, it's as a collection.
You interact with the image as a collection.
An image is everything defined in a single file.
Each full expression counts as an entity.

Import command is ! or !!
single exclamation imports the entire image at the point where it's evaluated.
double exclamation leaves the cache separate from the image and imports at the point where parts of the cache are used.



How to introduce a new expression?
An expression is a collection of types and symbols provided as the surface for the context.

	(Expression ".") : Expression. | e -> (e_0)
	(Expression "\n") : Expression. | e -> (e_0)
	("(" Expression ")") : Expression. | e -> (e_1)

You want to be explicit that you're making an expression, not just another surface.
This also makes the context more easily searchable by type because you can simply do
	% / (Expression | *) to get the collection of all the expressions.

How does select by type work?
It compares the possible values of the selecting type and if an element is value-equivalent to any of them, then it is yielded.



How to do multi-expression functions?
	x = 1, f : n -> n + 1, y = f x
In the line here, it's ambiguous that the last expression is separate from the function definition.
What I want is
	x = 1, f : n -> (n + 1), y = f x
But what parses is
	x = 1, f : n -> (n + 1, y = f x)
This is the same problem with nested lists.
	1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3
as
	1, (2.1, 2.2, 2.3), 3
but it's ambiguous without the parentheses.
Similarly, the function constructor grabs the expression following it, but it's ambiguous.
A possible solution is to enclose the entire function definition in parentheses,
	x = 1, f : (n -> n + 1) , y = f x
This is the problem with lists having no delimiters. 
Functions also have no delimiters.
How do I fix this?
"Begin" and "End"?
No, how about the period?
I already have it, it should be fine to use.
	x = 1, f : n -> n + 1 ., y = f x .
Yeah this works just fine.
So everything I alreay have works anyways.



How do I make a new expression?
It depends on how the Compute function works.
I know expressions are collections of stuff.
	{'a "b" [c]}
But symbols and strings can also be parameters in the expression.
How would I do function application?
	{Function Expression} | e -> ((e _ 0) (e _ 1))
How would I do addition?
	{Register '+ Register} | e -> add (e _ 0  e _ 1)
How do you differentiate between punctuation and a parameter?
By type.
Constructors are punctuation, types are parameters.
You can be specific as you want in the type, including the type of a type, but that way it's clear everything else is punctuation.
How do you tell an expression apart from everything else though?
By typing the collection as an expression. Then you can discriminate.



How can things be associative?

	{'k *}
	{'k Symbol}
	{'k Expression}

How are these three different?
The first two are the same. They do not look ahead, but consume the first computable value.
The third looks ahead until the end of an expression.



Should the size of a type and the size of the values of a type be different?
	x : t,
	## t /= ## x.
No, if a type is
	[Register]
then 
	## [Register] = ## Register



Types are just programs. 
If you want to determine if a value is included as part of that type, run the programs for that type.
What about a crazy kind of type?
	[x:t, y:t, z:k, ?(x p y)(y q z)(z r x)]



Expressions are just a specially interpreted collection.
Except that everything can be a specially interpreted collection and I turn into a lisp. blech!
Expressions are their own datatype.
Quoting expressions and stuff is hard to represent as a collection.
You start overloading collection semantics with special cases for computation.
A quoted expression represents a whole program rather than just a collection.
What's the notation for a collection then?
The semicolon,
	; "a” T 'T ;
That makes a new expression.
What operations are available for an expession?
- quote
- unquote
- destructure
But aren't expressions the same as collections?
What if I want to write an expression that builds an expression that writes itself?
That would be a collection.
You can just take an expression to be a collection though.
	('f 'x):Expression
	{'f 'x}:Expression
	; 'f 'x ;
these are all the same, but the last line allows you to avoid writing out the type when its use is obvious to the user.
In all instances, an expression is a collection of syntax entities.
	Expression: (( 2 '- 1) '+ 1)



Need semantics for interpreting numerical and string constants.
There's textual data which acts as a constructor.
All symbols are strings.
Numerical symbols are constant values.
The value expressed by a number is exact.
Semantics for how a number is interpreted should be at the program level, not a compiler thing.
The rest of the syntax is the same.
A numerical symbol is a constant.
A string is not a constant.



How to clobber stuff.
What is a binding?
A binding is a program that yields some entity held in the context.
There's two ways, accessing a collection or using an expression.
Binding is
	x = 1
resulting in
	; 'x ; | %\(# %) <- 1
in plain english, binding an unbound symbol first clobbers the value being bound into the context. Then it exposes it as a surface using an expression containing the symbol being bound.



Compute has a type which is dependent on the value the expression produces.
If I say 
	(n -> n + 1) (compute "string")
I get a type error because compute doesn't produce a numerical value.



Should there be error effects?
Say
	f = x -> x + 1. ,
	f (1 2)
should application use an error handling thing?
No.
What about
	x : [n = Value, ? n > 30 n _],
	x = random.



what happens when I run a program?
I have an expression
	1 + 1
this is Read as 
	;1 '+ 1;
which can be passed to the context to recieve a result.



Is there a way to cause a dynamic error during computation? 
Yes, but it's hard to achieve.
	c = {% ``x},
	% <- c .
This is a type error



How to tell the difference between an expression and a collection?
	{ {'a 'b 'c} '/ 'a}
Because you need to have a quote and unquote.
	quote ({'a 'b 'c} / 'a)



How do you treat a symbol as data?
The single quote
	'symbol
How do you treat an expression as data?
Single quote with parentheses
	'(expression)
How do you evaluate a quoted symbol?
	('symbol)
How do you evaluate a quoted expression?
	('(expression))
How do you destructure a quoted expression?
'(1 + 1)\0 = 1
'(1 + 1)\1 = '+
'(1 + 1)\2 = 1
Why are some symbols quoted but other symbols are not?
It depends on the expression form.
In the case of addition, it's 
	; Value '+ Value ;
quotation works by using the apostrophe to quote an expression
	' 1 + 1
	' n -> n + 1
You quote a symbol as
	` x
or
	` x.
to avoid ambiguity

The expression constructor is two semicolons.
It allows shorthand notation for various forms of repetition.
	; Value 'x "%" [A B] * ;



How does evaluation work?
The initial context has a number of built-in functions which facilitate the default expression semantics.
A function entity has an implementation dependent representation.
All the default types depend on the implementation and environment.
What is my evaluation model?
Compute gets an expression, it passes the expression to the context surface.
It the expression is defined, then the context returns some other expression to compute.
This process repeats until compute passes a default expression and recieves an entity.
What about functions?
Functions are an assumed type and application is a default expression.
Applying a function is managed by the environment.
Functions contain expressions though.
Functions are equivalent to binding a symbol and computing a quoted expression.



Evaluation model is this, for every function call and surface interaction, a new context is created.
In each context is
	{ External-Context : Collection
	  Current-Expression : Expression
	  Other-Stuff : * }
Once Compute completes the current expression, it replaces the context with the result in the external context.
If you replace the context with a value, it short circuits the computation.
If you replace the current expression with another expression, it short circuits the computation, but you keep the same context.



How is an expression evaluated?
	"First bind an expression as a surface",
	% + {{'add Value 'to Value}| e -> e\1 + e\3},
	"Then you use the expression",
	add 1 to 2.
Now read reads in the expression.
You get 
	{'add 1 'to 2}
Compute passes it to the context surface
	(e\Expression %)
It recieves another expression and calls Compute on it.
What computes compute?
The environment.
The environment provides the basic functions from outside the scope of the language even though the language can inspect its own environment.



Collections use result polymorphism.
	1 {1 | 'a  1 | 'b} : 'b = 'b

Can functions be defined for multiple things?
Yes.
	f : x -> x + 1,
	f : x -> x / T,
	f {n:T} = T,
	f 1 = 2.



What happens when you clobber the context?
How does it affect control?
Because the expression being evaluated is inside the context.
	n = 1,
	n <- n + 1,
	% <- n + 1,
	"code beyond here is not evalutated",
	n <- n + 1.
Why?



What is the context model?
In a context, you have
- The expression being evaluated
- The external context
- Bindings
How is this structured?
External context is first.
Then the expression being evaluated.
Functions are deferred computation.



Compute takes an experession and passes it to the context.
The context returns another expression.
What does that look like?


	Compute = e -> 
	 e:Collection,

What is a surface? 
It's a way to access information inside a collection.
When are surface interactions evaluated?
During execution.
	x : 1,
	c : {1 | 1},
	c x = 1

all expressions are reduced to 
- function application
	f x
- evaluation
	(x)
	(x y z)
- Conditional Evaluation
	? p q r
- sequence
	f x, g x
- interaction
	x c
- constant
	1
	'1
	"1"
	{1 1}
	[1 1]
- Default Operation
	Algebra
	Boolean logic
	Comparison
	Subscript
	Destructure
	Type of
	Size of
	Reference
	Dereferece

These operations are built into the environment and computing them produces implementation dependent behavior



What is my model for expressions?
An individual expression is a collection of constructors, punctuation, and nested expressions.
A quoted expression allows you to read in an expression as an unevaluated expression structure.
So 
	`1 + 1 = (1 '+ 1) = {1 '+ 1}
What about
	`1 + 2 - 3 = ((1 '+ 2) '- 3) = {{1 '+ 2} '- 3}
How do you tell the difference between an expression and a collection?
You quote punctuation differently than you quote a symbol.
Punctuation and types determine an expression.
Lisp only needs one quotation notation because the function is always the first in the list.
I can't because the function may have any form such as juxtaposition of two types of elements.
So how do I quote an expression?
The backquote.



How do I treat an expression as data?
An expression is a collection of symbols and other expressions.
How do you create an expression?
	e : Expression
	e\0 : 1
	e\1 : '+
	e\2 : 1
	e = `1 + 1
	e = (1 '+ 1)
If I say
	x : 1
then
	Compute ('x) = 1



VERY IMPORTANT PROPERTY
	c <- {x = y  y = x}
	c\0 = c\1



recursive expression possible?
	% + {'a} | 'b,
	% + {'b} | 'a,
	'a



how does string syntax work?
You say that there's some stuff in between two quotation marks.
Inside quotations, the backslash character has special syntax.
What you need is a character-by-character parsing algorithm.
I need two things, the type of a stream and the ability to express something that repeats.
A character type is any expression that's evaluated to produce a character.
Read is different. 
It has a collection of characters.
Can't be reader macros because you can jump in and out of interpreting characters.
Read takes a string and turns it into a data structure.
Does read bind things?
No.



IMPORTANT-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	? e : T 
	  T : e
	  ^e \= T
"if computing 'e' yeilds a value of type 'T', then it follows that it's possible to compute 'T' in such a way as to get 'e'.



How to make a list?
You have to create a new context where you grab everything.
Then you have to set a new context where you build the list structure.
I need a way to set a new context for a specific expression.
Say you can have any "c" between "a" and "b".
The expression returns the number of "c".
This requires two things, an intermediary value holding the number of "c".
And an order in which the "c"'s occur.
Order is determined by the order of the stream.
The "c"'s are in a sequence already.
So the solution is to allow new context to be set around a specific expression.
Given the expression form 
	{'a 'b ... 'c}
There's two expressions,
	{'a e 'c} 
and
	{'b ['b _]}


Expressions for a context are stored in a collection.
	% 'Expressions
They are distinct from the rest of the collections by location.



what are maps? 
Aren't they just closures?
Can't you do that with syntax?
Not really.
	d : {'a | 'b  'c | {1}}
	'a 'c d = 'b
You can't do this with closures.
There's a mechanism for propagating across contexts.



ASC is an inductive pure type system.
The ":" and "[ .. ]" operators allow the construction of new types which are just terms on a higher stratification.

So then the ASC type system consists of sorts or entities "A"
And has the rules,
	(A_0,A_0)				.... Base
	(A_n,A_n),(A_n,A_m),(A_m,A_n),(A_m,A_m)	.... Inductive
so what does this look like in ASC?



Symbols are any sequence of alphabetic characters with no white space.
Values are symbols prefixed with a single quote.
Types are one or more unique values.
Types can occur as values in other types.



not worrying about the inductive proof.



what is the nature of maps and collection surfaces?
theres a collection.
it has some elements.
you can access those elements by destructuring the collection.
you can also provide more complex polymorphic interactions.
what do i mean by interaction?
is this a function?


IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ASC is not based on the Lambda Calculus, It's based on objects.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what do I mean by that?
A function is actually an abstraction in my language.
The most primitive abstraction for "doing something" in my language is 
passing an event to a collection.
The primitive ops are
- collection constructor	{ ... }
- clobber			_ <- _
- bind				_ | _
- sequence			... , ...
- this				%
- deconstruct			_ \ _
- cardinality			# _
- value				' _

is this all I need?
Yes
So how to do recursion?
By an event passing it to itself.
Self reference.
{* | % *}




Semantics are based on interactions.
Rather than message passing, one object is introduced to another with a reaction defined.



If I have a collection
	c : {'a 'a 'a}
and I compute
	c / 'a
i get 
	{'a 'a 'a}
but how do i get one of the elements when they're the same type?
By casting. 
If I have the same collection and I cast it to a nested collection
	c ~ {'a {}} / 'a = 'a
This is a terrible kludge for just indexing.
However the index of a collection is unique to each collection.
What if you can index based on anything?



Get rid of function notation an functions alltogether.
You don't need them.
Instead of passing functions, you pass around collections.
If you want to make a function, all you do is
{* -> p}
You can't really shadow anything though which makes things hard.
But on the other hand, context and binding in the context are first-class structures.
How would this look?
It would look terrible.



What is binding?
Binding is when you use a symbol as an expression.
	(Expression : {'x}) | 'value
Binding is another form of macro.



What are my semantics for computation.
Compute is given a program representation as some "p" where
	(p)
and P is composed of one or more nested expressions.



What order should computation reduce expressions?
It finds the first expression that has no nested expressions.
It uses that expression to interact with the context.
The context produces more data or another expression.



What if I use period like a lambda abstraction?
	x . x + x
How do I talk about functions in a generic way?
when i talk about the type of a function, i don't talk about the symbol used as a parameter.




how do pointers work?
they arent typed.

x . x + x



	x <- 1
	y <- x @
	z <- y @
How do pointers work?
Are they typed?
Yes.



So what's my fucking notation now???

Assignment: _ ; _
Binding: _ : _
Parameterization: _ . _
Application: _ _ 
Interaction: _ _

How does juxtaposition work?
Can you juxtapose in either direction?

	f : Function,
	c : Collection,
	x c f,
	x f c,
	f x c,
	f c x,
	c x f,
	c f x

so you can actually juxtapose in any direction.
What about currying?
	
	g : (Function *): Function,
	g c f x x = g(c f x)(x),
	g c f x c = g((c (f x))c)
what is the algorithm here for application?
you have a sequence of juxtaposed terms.
how are they reduced?
You have an something that can be applied and something that can't, then there's several cases
- a a	the first is applied on the second
- a c	the first is applied on the second
- c a	the second is applied on the first
- c c	none are applied, this is two separate expressions.
So aren't infix operators just
{* | x . {* | y . op(x y)}}



I don't know if I like my syntax.
The symbols and names for things aren't that great.
How do I do better?

Constructors are obvious
Types:		[ ... ]
Collections:	{ ... }
Compute:	( ... )

Type Binding is the colon	:
Clobber is the semicolon	;
They're both forms of binding.

I also need shortcuts to refer to
Type of Types:		[]
Type of Collections:	{}
Type of Functions:	()
Type of Expressions:	()
Type of Symbols:	Symbol
Type of Anything:	*
Type of Nothing:	_
Is there any point where I would need an empty version of any of these?
No, in most cases where I'm talking about empty constructors, I'm talking about the generalized types of those.

What about destructuring collections?
You can select by type or by position.
Select by type:		_ / _
Select by index:	_ \ _
Might be a complaint that these operators aren't clear.
What else can be used for selecting?
Underscore, colon, semicolon, period...
I think the forward and backward slash are fine for this.

Should the function constructor be an arrow or a dot?
x . x + x
x -> x + x
An arrow. It's more clear what's going on.
If that's the constructor, how do I write a function type?
It's different than a function constructor because I'm not talking about which symbols I'm binding as parameters.
It would be more like 
"Something applied to something computes to something"
Is a function the same as an expression?
Yes actually.
So then a function of A to B would be 
	(Function A : B)



What's minimal ASC?
no types
everything is a Value
You have arithmetic
the ability to clobber
equality comparison
no variable names, everything is from the context.



Fixed context elements:
% / Expression
% / 


How to identify what is an expression in the context and what is a normal binding?
Make an expression type.
({'b} | 1) : Expression



A property where
(x -> x : 1) *  = 1



What happens when I clobber a surface?
% ; % + 1 | 1, % 1 ; 2
You can't actually clobber a surface.
You can replace it with another surface.



If you need a context then you need to forcibly enter a new context.
How do you do that?

%\#% <- Expression : 
	{'a} | % <- 	{
			% 
			count : Value 
			(Expression : {'b} | count <- count + 1)
			(Expression : {'c} | % <- %)
      			}



What's the minimal syntax?
	{ ... }
	( ... )
	_ <- _
	%
	_ = _
	_ /= _
	_ < _
	_ > _
	@ _
	^ _



how does construction work?
You claim a portion of storage not less than the storage requirements of the constructed object.
The storage portion is treated as a place and is given a unique place value.



how are collections made?
Can elements in a collection be in separate locations?
Yes. 
The collection is an object and the objects "in" the collection are separate.
Does this mean that the entities in the collection can be in non-adjacent locations?
Yes.
How to enforce something has an adjacent location?
What information does a collection actually contain then?
The location of each of its elements.
Is there any case where type information should be dynamically included?
Type information is stored separately from the program.
So what happens if I query the type of something?
	^ x
The type information is constant.
What is type information?
The program that results in the type.
So if 
	x : T
then
	^ x = T
you're not actually querying the type of the binding.
You're querying the type of the entity that the binding evaluates to.
So 
	^ [a b c] = Type
	^ (a : [a b c]) = [a b c]
	^ 1 : [1] = [1]
How are types held in a context?
Say that you make a new type. 
How is it incorporated with other types?



The type system is not affected by context?
Or is it?
If I have 
	a = Type, b = Type, c = Type,
	x : [a b] = b,
	y : [a b c] = b,
	^ x, ^ y
the type needs to be bound in the context.
if the type is released from a context then you can't use it.
Also how about enums?
	T = [a:Type b:Type c:Type]
what does an unbound symbol in a type mean?
That it's a value of that type.



how does each expression handle unbound symbols?
1	(a)
2	[a]
3	{a}
4	a = 'e
5	a : t

1: returns a semantic error that "a" is not computable
2: binds 'a as a value to the type
3: returns a semantic error that "a" is not computable
4: binds "a" to 'e
5: binds "a" to t
Are these computed?
Yes, compute dispatches a program which decides how to bind the unbound symbols.



a collection is a separate entity from its elements.
a collection and each of its elements each have unique locations.
what about data that's adjacent?
use a value type for that.
you have default values and you can create new compound values from that.



what about operator precedence in arithmetic?
	Sum : Number
	Product : Number
	Exponent : Number
	% <- % + {}



There's a collision between how a function is constructed and how it's typed.
A function constructor takes a parameter name as a symbol, but it does not allow for an input type to be specified with the parameter.
The purpose of a function is twofold. 
It creates a symbolic substitution of a variable with an input parameter.
It encloses an expression in a context which is evaluated later.
Thus a function is structurally typed according to the input-output pair, and it exists as a syntactic form.
Using arrow notation, how should a function be given a parameter and a type?
        f : T -> t
        f = x -> y
So the function constructor has the form
        {Symbol '-> Expression}
When should the function constructor have the form
        {Expression '-> Expression}
that's simple, it would be
        f : (T) -> t
        f = x -> y
Because the type of () always yields an expression.



Data description.
The environment assumes the presence of two capabilities:
The ability to hold data while a transformation is being applied.
The ability to store data while it is not being held.
A minimum of two data formats are required, a format for transformations and a 
format for storage.
The storage format is called a Byte.
The transformation format is called a Word.



What are my terms?
A collection can include a surface as an element.
A surface maps some entity to another entity, the reaction.
A program may interact with a Collection by providing it with an entity matching the type of entity in the surface.
The collection will then produce the reaction entity.



How do I create expressions?
By backtick and parens.
`(1 '+ 1)
It's the same as asserting that you're creating an expression
(1 '+ 1):Expression
So how would you do a macro?
	% <- % + `{'o T} | t, o T
	`(`(`(%) '<- `(% '+ `(`({'o T}:Expression) '| `(t))) ', `('o T))





How do macros work if they require the interleaving of Read and Compute?
