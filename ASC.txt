the Abstract System for Computation

Overview
	The Abstract System for Computation (abbreviated as ASC) is a tool 
designed for describing, performing, an reasoning about computation. It exists 
as a written notation and an environment for verifying and interpreting the
notation. This document outlines the capabilities and requirements of a 
verified implementation of ASC.

	ASC is a minimal language designed such that it can be adapted to the
widest possible range of computational scenarios. It provides a simple set of 
constructs: functions, collections, types.

Environment
	The environment provides the resources for computation to take place.
These resources are abstracted as the functions, "Compute", "Display", "Read",
"Import", and "Export".

Syntax
	ASC syntax represents the correspondence between a written program and 
its computable model. Syntax is composed of a sequence of characters grouped 
into sub-sequences called Symbols. These symbols are combined into Expressions.
Expressions are then composed into the computable model of a program.

	The character block below visualizes the minimum characters required 
for the ASC notation.

	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

	+ - * / < > =
	@ # % ^ & | \ ~ !
	' " ` . , ; :
	( ) [ ] { } _ ?

	In addition to the required characters above, the blank space and line 
break characters are also required.

Symbols
	Symbols are sequences of characters that do not include blank space or
line breaks. Symbols may also be punctuation defined for an expression.

Expressions
	Expressions are a sequence of symbols which are associated with a 
function. Defined expressions are exposed as surfaces in the Context.

Default Operations
	When the environment is initialized, it must be provided a set of 
entities enabling the default ASC notation.

Default Types
	ASC assumes the presence of a collection of initial types. The initial 
types are "Any", "Nil", "Value", "Data", "Collection", "Function", "Type",
"Expression", "Symbol", and "Constant.

Environment
	The ASC environment is responsible for marshalling the resources 
required for computing. It provides functions for accessing resources. They 
are, "Compute", "Export", "Cache", "Import", "Read", "Display".
