Standard Documentation for an Abstract System for Computation

This document covers the formation and interpretation of a programming language called the Abstract System for Computation, abbreviated as the name "ASC".
ASC is intended to be a highly expressive general purpose programming language.
Here, "Programming language" to mean that ASC will be capable of expressing the largest possible set of programs in the mathematical sense of the term.

The semantics of the ASC language follow the interaction of a number of programmatic entities. 
These entities interact through the process of expression evaluation.
Expressions are formed through writing a series of symbols comprised of sequences of characters.
A program is then represented by a series of expressions using notations composed of symbols and characters.

The characters required by ASC are... 
	- the upper and lower case alphabet, 
	- the arabic numerals 0-9, 
	- single, double, and backwards quotations, 
	- the colon and semicolon, 
	- the period dot, 
	- the comma, 
	- forward and backward slashes, 
	- round, curly, triangle, and curved braces, 
	- the tilde, 
	- the exclamation point, 
	- the "at" symbol, 
	- the pound sign, 
	- the dollar sign, 
	- the percent sign, 
	- the caret, 
	- the ampersand, 
	- the asterisk, 
	- the underscore, 
	- the dash, 
	- the plus, 
	- the equals sign, 
	- the question mark,
	- the blank space.

The text block below displays all necessary symbols (excepting the blank space)...
	
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	0123456789
	`'"~_
	!@#$%^&
	=+-*/.,
	\;:(){}[]<>

It's likely that ASC programs will be stored as digital text, using encodings that provide more characters than what's required here.
Therefore, 
Formatting and control characters are ignored but are still allowed to occur in a program and may change the appearance of the program's textual representation.

Some characters may not be used in the default notations provided by the ASC language. 
However, they are still considered necessary as ASC allows one to devlop new notations to use within the language.
A greater variety of characters is convenient for creating new notations.

Every program posesses qualities regarding its behavior, the values it can manupilate, the structures it contains, and so on.
Types are provided by ASC as a means to perform automated reasoning about the qualities of a program.
Types give a name to the qualities associated with a specific entity.
The qualities of a program can then be extrapolated from the types of the entities that compose it.
All entities in a program have a type.
Types themselves are entities in a program and each have their own type.
This self-referential pattern can be continued as far as necessary by the programmer.
