The Abstract System for Computation

The Abstract System for Computation is a utility for creating programs.
The term program is used in the general sense to refer to a set of instructions to perform some transformations on information.
It has three distinct components.
The system of types specifies what a program may do.
The system of data specifies how information is stored.
The system of expression specifies how a program is constructed.
With these three systems, every entity in every possible ASC program has a type, a physical location, and can be written.
Programs manifest from the interaction between the three systems.
The system of types constrains how programs may be written correctly and provide abstractions over data.
The system of data provides the correct formats for storing each program component.
The system of expression connects types with data and provides rules for how to execute a program.
