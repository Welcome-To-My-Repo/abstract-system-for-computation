Compiler uses a crud database design.

Communication protocol sends code and compilation commands to the compiler.

executables are extracted by specifying a function or module.

entities are stored as conflict free replicated data types

syntax highlighting has colors for each category of syntax:
	- single-character notation strings
	- multi-character notation strings
	- notation symbols
	- constants
	- type names (collections are types)
	- function names
	- module names
	- ability to assign an extra color to a notation

Compiler is a server entity.
Keeps a database of code entities that are defined.
Can have multiple communication sockets sending code and recieving stats
Sockets can be over the network
multiple compilers can be chained together and synchronized.

compiler has a visual programming mode where functions are nodes.

calling convention literally matches C so you can just call shit.
that is to say that the calling convention matches the convention of the 
underlying system.
