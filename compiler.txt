Communication protocol sends code and compilation commands to the compiler.

executables are extracted by specifying a function or module.

entities are stored as conflict free replicated data types

	- single-character notation strings
	- multi-character notation strings
	- notation symbols
	- constants
	- type names (collections are types)
	- function names
	- module names
