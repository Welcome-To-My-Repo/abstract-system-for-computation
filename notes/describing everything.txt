ASC-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASC is a programming language.
"Abstract System for Computation"
It's a mathematical programming languagee based on a meta language for describing geometry.
"Mathematical programming language" means that it has several key features.
They are
	- explicit eager and lazy evaluation.
	- explicit contexts.

Because ASC is a systems programming langauge, contexts map directly to how contexts are managed in assembly.

Context-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contexts represent the collection of entities which are accessible at a given point in the evaluation of a program.
Contexts are created by functions and modules.
Module contexts are static as modules persist for the duration of a program.
Function contexts are dynamic because they are created when a function is applied and discarded when the evaluation of a function application is completed.

Entities are created and discarded with contexts.
Most entities will be declared as modules as it is desireable for things such as functions and constants to persist, and be accessible, for the duration of a program.
Other things such as function parameters or closures need only persist as they are needed in a discrete statge of a program.

Semantics-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A program is composed of entities.
Each entity has a duration, size, location, and context.

Duration------------------------------------------------------------------------
The process of evaluating a program is assumed to occupy some amount of time.
The duration of an entity is then some amount of time which is less or equal to the time taken to evaluate the entire program.

Context-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contexts affect duration and accessibility of entities.
Contexts are created in a nested hierarchy.
