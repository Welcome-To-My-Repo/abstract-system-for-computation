The concept of "this" which represents the evaluational context as a collection.
Collections and functions create new contexts.
When evaluation of a function or collection completes normally, the context is replaced with the result.
When evaluating inside a function or collection, you can clobber This to yeild a
result of whatever you clobber it with.


Collections encapsulate all their bindings.
They are not visible to the external context.

Everything in the environment has a type, location, and size.
Any entity in the context can be queried for its type, location, or size.
