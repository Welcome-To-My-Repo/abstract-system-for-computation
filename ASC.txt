Overview
	The Abstract System for Computation (abbreviated as ASC) is a tool designed for describing, performing, an reasoning about computation. 
It exists as a written notation and an environment for verifying and interpreting the notation. 
This document outlines the capabilities and requirements of a verified implementation of ASC.

	ASC is a minimal language designed such that it can be adapted to the widest possible range of computational scenarios. 
It provides a simple set of constructs: functions, collections, types.

Environment
	The environment provides the resources for computation to take place.
These resources are abstracted as the functions, "Compute", "Display", "Read", "Import", and "Export".

	The "Compute" function accepts a program model as the result of an invocation of "Read" or another function which creates a model. 
"Compute" shall

Syntax
	ASC syntax represents the correspondence between a written program and its computable model. 
Syntax is composed of a sequence of characters grouped into sub-sequences called Symbols. 
These symbols are combined into Expressions.
Expressions are then composed into the computable model of a program.

	The character block below visualizes the minimum characters required for the ASC notation.

In addition to the required characters above, the blank space and line break characters are also required.

Symbols
	Symbols are sequences of characters that do not include blank space or line breaks. 
Symbols may also be punctuation defined for an expression.

Expressions
	Expressions are a sequence of symbols which are associated with a function. 
Defined expressions are exposed as surfaces in the Context.
