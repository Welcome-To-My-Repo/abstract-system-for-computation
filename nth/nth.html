	<h1>Standard Documentation for the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> System for Computation</h1>
	<article>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			This document contains the specification of "<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>", a system for creating and performing computations.
			This system is intended to be generally useful when applied to any problem which requires computing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system is comprised of a description language for composing programs and a small environment to compute those programs.
			In this document, the name "<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>" refers to the description language.
			The term "environment" shall refer to the mechanisms and resources through which computation is facilitated.
		</p>
		<p>
			As this document is a specification, all properties and behaviors of the system as described are considered requirements for an implementation.
		</p>

		<h2>Syntax</h2>
		<p>
			<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> is written as a sequence of characters.
			The basic characters needed to write an <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> program is supported by the ASCII character encoding, but <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> is intended to support the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/">Unicode&reg;</a> character encoding.
			The minimal set of characters is classified into the following catagories, <i>letters</i>, <i>digits</i>, <i>blanks</i>, and <i>glyphs</i>.
