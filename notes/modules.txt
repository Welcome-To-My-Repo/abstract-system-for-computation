What is a module?
A Module is a pair of a type specification and an implementation where the 
specification is visible to places outside the module and the implementation is
hidden from those places.

We'll call the specification the "surface" and the implemntation the 
"structure".

In an image based environment, the active image can be "cached" by storing it 
in a serialized binary format to be loaded into an active state at some later
point. An image can be "sharded" where one or more entities are stored as a 
separate image. These images can then be "loaded" which incorporates them as an 
immediate part of the active image, or "linked" where the image will be loaded
at some unspecified point before or at the moment it is used.

A module is an entity within an image based environment.
It has a surface component and a structure component.
