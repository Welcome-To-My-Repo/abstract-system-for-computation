Syntax is made of double-width unicode characters.
A compressed-non unicode ASCII encoding which uses the top 128 characters.
A utf-8 encoding which allows for full unicode compatibility.

The strange thing is that using unique symbols actually makes the language more 
portable to different world regions because you can count on everyone everywhere
having a UTF-8 compliant web browser
