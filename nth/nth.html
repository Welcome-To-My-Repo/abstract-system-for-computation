	<h1>Standard Documentation for the <b><i>n</i></b><sup>th</sup> System for Computation</h1>
	<p>
		This document contains the specification of "<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>", a system for creating and performing computations.
		This system is intended to be generally useful across all tasks which require computing.
		The system is comprised of a description language for composing programs and a small environment to compute those programs.
		In this document, the name "nth" refers to the description language.
		The term "environment" shall refer to the mechanisms and resources through which computation is facilitated.
		As this document is a specification, all properties and behaviors of the system as described in this document are considered requirements for an implementation of this system.
