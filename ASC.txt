Overview
	The Abstract System for Computation (abbreviated as ASC) is a tool 
designed for describing, performing, an reasoning about computation. It exists 
as a written notation and an environment for verifying and interpreting the
notation. This document outlines the capabilities and requirements of a 
verified implementation of ASC.

	ASC is a minimal language designed such that it can be adapted to the
widest possible range of computational scenarios. It provides a simple set of 
constructs: functions, collections, types. It also introuces new constructs 
which are generalized forms of multiple different concepts in computation: 
surfaces, contexts, and reflection.
