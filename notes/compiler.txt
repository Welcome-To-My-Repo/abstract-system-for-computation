The ASC Compiler

It has a single function: Compute.
Compute accepts written programs, programs as data, or any other format of a program.
It also has import, link, compile, decompile, and display.
These are discrete functions because they change the environmet not the image.

You invoke the compiler with one or more files you want to run.
Alternatively, you can invoke the compiler with no files in which case it will open a listener to accept program text.

Files are run in sequential order.

How does the compiler fit the semantics of ASC?
It has an initial environment.
The initial environment contains a mode exposing an interface that accepts programs and feeds them to Compute.
