		<h1>Standard Documentation for the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> System for Computation</h1>

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			This document contains the specification of "<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>", a system for creating and performing computations.
			This system is intended to be generally useful when applied to any problem which requires computing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system is comprised of a description language for composing programs and a small environment to compute those programs.
			In this document, the name "<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>" refers to the description language.
			The term "environment" shall refer to the mechanisms and resources through which computation is facilitated.
		</p>
		<p>
			As this document is a specification, all properties and behaviors of the system as described are considered requirements for an implementation.
		</p>

		<h1>Syntax</h1>
		<h2>Character Set</h2>
		<p>
			<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> is written as a sequence of characters.
			The minimal set of characters required to write an <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> program is supported by the printable subset of the ASCII character encoding (all characters excluding control characters).
			<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> is intended to be compatible with any character encoding which provides the same set of printable characters as the ASCII encoding.
			For the purposes of this standard, the ASCII subset is assumed, with the addition of a line break character.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> assumes a classification of characters which is applied to any encoding.
			A character may either be a Digit, Glyph, or Blank.
			<span id="Digit">A Digit is a character corresponding to one of the ten decimal digits.</span>
			<span id="Glyph">A Glyph is any character which is visible when printed.</span>
			<span id="Blank">A Blank is any character which results in some blank space or formatting structure when printed.</span>
		</p>
		<h2>Grammatical Components</h2>
		<p>
			The grammatical components of an <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> program are classified as Symbols, Numbers, and Punctuation.
			These are combined to form a <a href="#Program-Model">Program Model</a>.
		</p>
		<p id="Symbol">
			A Symbol is any sequence of characters not including <a href="#Punctuation">Punctuation</a> or a <a href="#Blank">Blank</a>.
		</p>
		<p id="Number">
			A Number is any symbol which only contains decimal digits.
			Numbers may optionally include either a fractional or decimal component as a forward slash or period dot respectively.
			These components cannot occur as the first or last character in the Number.
			Numbers may optionally include a sign component as a plus or dash.
			The sign can only occur as the first character in the Number.
		</p>
		<p id="Punctuation">
			Punctuation is any one of the following characters, <code>(){}[],'"</code>.
			A Punctuation character represents grammatical structure and cannot be treated as a Symbol.
		</p>
		<h2>Constructors</h2>
		<p>
			Some punctuation is used to denote structured data.
			There are several forms of structured data for which <a href="#Punctuation">Punctuation</a> is provided.
			They are the <a>Quote</a>, <a>Collection</a>, <a>String</a>, and <a>Type</a>.
		</p>
		<p id="Quote-Notation">
			The Quote is denoted by the apostrophe followed by a program.
		</p>
		<p id="Collection-Notation">
			The Collection is denoted by a closed pair of curly braces surrounding zero or more programs.
		</p>
		<p id="String-Notation">
			The String is denoted by a pair of double quotes surrounding zero or more characters.
			<a href="#Digit">Digits</a>, <a href="#Glyph">Glyphs</a>, and <a href="#Blank">Blanks</a> may all be included in between the pair of double quotes and is interpreted as part of the String structure.
			The backward slash character is an exception and is not interpreted as part of a String.
			A backward slash followed by a double quote or another backward slash asserts that the double quote or backward slash is included, uninterpreted, as part of the String.
			A backward slash followed by one or more <a href="#Digit">Digits</a> ending in a dot is interpreted as a number, represented by the <a href="#Digit">Digits</a>, corresponding to a character code identifying a character which will be included in the String.
		</p>
		<p id="Type-Notation">
			The Type is denoted by a closed pair of square braces surrounding zero or more programs.
		</p>
		<h2>The Program Model</h2>
		<p id="Program-Model">
			A Program Model is some structured data corresponding to a written <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> program.
			It unambiguously represents the data used by a program and the exact order of the manipulations performed on that data.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <a href="#Program-Model">Program Model</a> is created using Expressions and Sequences.
			<span id="Expression">An Expression is a closed pair of round braces surrounding zero or more programs.</span>
			<span id="Sequence">A Sequence is a series of programs separated by a comma.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			The grammar below describes all possible valid sequences of characters which can form a <a href="#Program-Model">Program Model</a>.
			In this grammar, the arrow (&rarr;) denotes one or more character sequences listed after the arrow which may occurr at a position identified by the name given left of the arrow.
			The bar (|) separates two individual character sequences.
			The star (*) suffixes a sequence that can occur one or more times.
			Characters shown in <code>monospace</code> font represent literal characters that can occur at that position.
		</p>
