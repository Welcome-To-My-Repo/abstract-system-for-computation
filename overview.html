<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This document describes the properties of an Abstract System for Computation (ASC), a general purpose tool for computing.
</p>
</article>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
This document specifies...
</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntactic and semantic properties of the ASC language.</li>
<li>the capabilities and limitations of the ASC environment.</li>
<li>all assumptions made about the world outside the environment.</li>
<li>any data which should be provided by default</li>
<li>the methods for interpreting the ASC language</li>
</ul>
<p>
This document does not specify...
</p>
<ul>
<li>requirements for anything outside the environment.</li>
<li>methods for translating the ASC language to another language</li>
<li>the storage format of the environment and data in it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
<p>
ASC provides a session-based environment where data is held in an <a>image</a>.
The image is an archival format which can be exported from and imported to a session.
This allows data to persist between multiple sessions.
</p>
<p>
Each session allows one or more bidirectional streams for input and output to the environment.
These streams are used to submit programs to the environment for computation and to recieve data resulting from any invocations of the <a>display</a> function.
