<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h2>Computation</h2>
<p>
As humanity progresses, there are distinct milestones where human thought crosses into a higher domain.
The advent of spoken language is the first of such milestones.
Normally this capability is taken for granted, but consider the nature of verbal communication.
Language, as a format for the transfer of information, is astounding.
Put in contemporary terms, spoken language is a highly compressed and optimized streaming format for arbitrary data. 
Compression and decompression of complex circular data models are performed at the speed of thought.
Transmission happens at the speed of sound and can be completed reliably over almost any medium, at a great distance, with no line of sight or direct physical connection required.
Massive amounts of information can be broadcast to a near unlimited number of nodes and various degrees of amplification solve any distance limitations.
</p>
<p>
The next milestone was reading and writing.
Language solved the problem of transmission, but literacy solved the problem of storage.
Information stored as writing is unbelievably resistant to entropy.
For example, writing on stone can still be read thousands of years after it was engraved.
With storage came an important capability.
Information can be stored, but then later it can be inspected, copied, and even modified.
This allowed humans to record concepts precisely that multiple parties could then iterate on.
With access to efficient transmission and storage methods for information, the process of human thought became capable of highly advanced conceptualizations.
It's not uncommon today to see concepts that require multiple people cooperating via literacy and verbalization to develop a single complex model.
You can observe this in the presence of things such as cannon in fictional worlds and superhero comics, complex scientific and mathematical procedures, and self-help books that describe new ways of thought which are literally life-changing.
</p>
<p>
Now comes the next and current milestone, mechanized computation.
The process of computation can be generalized as the means of generating information.
For a long while, the term "computer" referred to a live person who would spend time and effort carrying out complex mathematical and scientific tasks.
They used writing to store models, instructions, and intermediary results.
They communicated the information they generate through spoken language. 
But the process of computation was limited by human thought, which is now understood to be slow and noisy.
Mechanized computation was developed to replace the human computer.
</p>
<p>
General purpose computers are the latest refinement of this idea.
They can be adapted to an unlimited range of computational tasks.
Modern computers have enourmous amounts of resources available for carrying out computation.
They can create, store, and present information several orders of magnitude faster than the speed of thought.
Once again, human consciousness crosses into a higher domain where it is no longer limited by human biology.
Now thought can be isolated in an optimized format, and dispatched to a machine to be thunk.
The latest development is machines that marshall multiple individual actors as computing cores. 
Rather than a human being paired with a single accellerator, they can be paired with 16, 32, or even more mechanical parties which can all be dispatched simultaneously to crunch information.
</p>
<h2>Talking to Computers</h2>
<p>
The current state of things regarding the relationship of human thought and computers is not quite optimal.
As computers continue to be developed with speed in mind, the nature of their construction and operation becomes less and less like that of how a human thinks.
The problem of how to "talk to" or program a computer has become the main bottleneck.
The most popular approach by far is to program a compute using writing.
Computers are much faster at reading than a person is, so the unit of dispatch between a human and a computer becomes the written program.
The caveat is that computers may be fast at computing, but they do not possess as wide and deep a domain of thought as a human.
Thus any thought which is dispatched to a computer must be reduced to a highly simplified language with limited context and scope.
</p>
<p>
If one were to equate human-to-computer language with human-to-human language, the most advanced and intuitive methods of computer programming are equivalent to a highly verbose sentence diagram.
Additionally, a description of the alphabet and a dictionary must be included with the diagram as well as definitions of the grammatical rules resulting in each word's position on the diagram.
Normally a human carries information such as the alphabet and grammar with them at all times, and can draw upon those resources at any time they wish.
But a computer must start from scratch every time.
This doesn't necessarily constitute a problem, computers are fast enough at their mechanized form of thinking that it's not necessary for them to "learn" as a human does.
However, it becomes one when the method of transmission from human-to-computer is inefficient, as it is today.
