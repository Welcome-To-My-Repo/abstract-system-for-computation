<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This document describes the properties of an Abstract System for Computation (ASC), a general purpose tool for computing.
ASC consists of two interdependent components, an algorithmic language and an environment for computing programs described in that language.

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
This document specifies...
</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntactic and semantic properties of the ASC language.</li>
<li>the capabilities and limitations of the ASC environment.</li>
<li>all assumptions made about the world outside the environment.</li>
<li>any data which should be provided by default</li>
<li>the methods for interpreting the ASC language</li>
</ul>
<p>
This document does not specify...
</p>
<ul>
<li>requirements for anything outside the environment.</li>
<li>methods for translating the ASC language to another language</li>
<li>the storage format of the environment and data in it</li>

<p>
ASC provides a session-based interface with one or more bidirectional streams.
These streams convey character data representing the ASC language.
Data can be entered into the environment for computation through these streams.
The environment can send data back out across the stream using a pre-defined <a href="environment.html#Display">display</a> function.
</p>
<p>
The environment holds all data in an <a>image</a>.
An image is an archival format which can be exported from and imported to a session.
This allows data to persist between multiple sessions.
</p>
<p>
ASC represents programs as data.
The ASC language as it is written is translated to a structured data format before it is computed.
The process of computation involves inspecting the program data structure for pre-defined substructural patterns and performing transformations.
