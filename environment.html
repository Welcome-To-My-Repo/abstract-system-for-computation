<h1>Environment</h1>
<p>
The environment facilitates the process of computation.
It provides some basic capabilities and abstractions such that all ASC programs recieve the same view of the external environment.

<h2 id="Compute">The Compute Function</h2>
<p>
The Compute function accepts a program model.
It will iteratively reduce the structure of the model until a single constant is left.
This process is not required to halt.
</p>
<p>
The Compute function will also accept a <i>String</i> instead of a program model.
It will apply the <i>Read</i> function to that string and then apply itself to the program model resulting from that application.
</p>
<p>
Compute performs a reduction in the following steps...
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the first (leftmost) expression which does not contain a nested expression.</li>
<li><a>Interact</a> with the <a>Context</a> using that expression.</li>
<li>Substitute that expression with the <i>Reaction</i>.</li>
</ol>
<aside>
<h4>Choosing an Expression</h3>
<p>
A simple algorithm for determining which expression should be used to interact with the Context is to chose the expression which can be reached with the smallest sum of indicies.
Given that the program model consists of nested <i>Collections</i>, every nested expression can be reached by <a>index subscripting</a>.
It follows that the first expression which does not contain another nested expression should be reachable by the smallest index for each subscript operation performed.
Thus finding the minimal sum of index values to reach an expression will identify the first expression.

<h2 id="Read">The Read Function</h2>
<p>
The Read function accepts a <i>String</i> containing a written program.
It will build a program model which must be equivalent to the written program.

<aside>
<h4>Deciding Equivalence</h4>
<p>
The equivalence of a program model to a written program is decided by observing if the <i>Context</i>s resulting from computing both forms of the program are equivalent.
Thus equivalence between two programs can be expressed as the following program,<br>
<code>(Pm), A &lt;- %, (Pw), B &lt;- %, A = B</code><br>
where <code>Pm</code> corresponds to a program model and <code>Pw</code> corresponds to a written program and computing this program results in a boolean value signifying the equivalence or non-equivalence of the two programs.

<h2 id="Display">The Display Function</h2>
<p>
Display accepts any object and will emit a <a>String</a> containing a written program that results in that object when computed.
Display will always produce a well-formed written program such that <br>
<code>x : *, Compute Read Display x = x</code>

<h2 id="Program Model">The Program Model</h2>
<p>
The program model is a representation of a program as structured data.
</p>
</article>
<article>
<h2 id="Context">The Context</h2>
<p>
The Context is a <a>Collection</a> of entities which are used to compute a program.
The Context is a collection,<br>
<code>{Context, Expression, Collection}</code>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the external Context</li>
<li>the program model</li>
<li>a Collection of Surfaces representing syntactic forms</li>
</ul>
